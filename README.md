A modern Old School RuneScape client
- The client core is 100% Kotlin (plugins may be java or kotlin)
- Uses a Global design that drastically reduces boilerplate from RuneLite's dependency injection design (Koin can be used if need be)
- The UI is built using https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb, offering a modern, cross platform solution (client overlays still use swing)
- Uses many ideas / functionality from https://github.com/runelite/runelite
